The concept of temperature has always been confusing to me. On the one hand, we have statistical mechanics that seems to deduce the temperature definition $\frac{1}{T} = \left.\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial U}\right) \right|_{V,N}$ from statistical mechanics. On the other hand, we have our every day experience of temperature scales. We obviously don't measure the entropy of everything and do the partial derivative to their energy to get their temperature, but instead mark the temperature directly from a thermometer. How are they connected? How is that abstract temperature formula related to how we measure temperature in our everyday life? What on earth is temperature?

## Temperature from Statistical Mechanics

A system in thermodynamic equilibrium is said to be in a macro state, whose characteristics such as energy, volume, pressure and temperature can be directly measured.
A macro state is composed of many [microstates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstate_(statistical_mechanics)) which describe the detailed states of all particles in the system and are constantly transitioning into each other.

The analysis of statistical mechanics starts from the assumption that a system that has reached equilibrium is equally likely to be found in any of its accessible microstates.
We call this the "principle of equal a priori probabilities", the justification for which will be discussed in the next section.
For now, we take it as a given, and know that statistical mechanics built on this assumption has worked remarkably well.

Let's imagine putting two systems A and B next to each other so that they can exchange energies with each other.
What the equal probability principle tells us is that when A and B reach equilibrium with each other, the most likely scenario for the combined system is one in which the combined system has the most number of accessible states.

- ToDo: explain the quantity that's equal for the most likely macro states

- ! ToDo: why do we only focus on the most likely scenario?

- ToDo: how should the quantity correspond to temperature so that when reaching equilibrium, the direction of the energy flow is consistent with the increase of the entropy

## Justification for the Principle of Equal A Priori Probabilities

- Equal probability of transitions in both directions

## Empirical Temperature Scales

- history of ideal gas thermometer

- the definition of 0 and 100 degrees

- How that is connected to Kevin's absolute thermo temperature scale

## Connecting Statistical Mechanics with Empirical Temperature Scales

- ! How is the formula for temperature connected to Kevin's temperature (need to introduce Carno Cycle?)

## Re-define the Temperature Scale

- [redefinition of Boltzmann's constant and it's impact on definition of 1 Kevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units)
