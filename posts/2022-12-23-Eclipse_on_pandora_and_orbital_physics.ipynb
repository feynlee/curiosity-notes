    "\n",
    "After watching [Avatar: The Way of Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Way_of_Water), I'm quite intrigued by the eclipse in the movie.\n",
    "The sun is blocked by the gas giant for what appears to be a couple of hours, which seems to make sense if you assume that the sun travels across the sky in a similar amount of time as what we experience on Earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, on a deeper thought, the situation here is more complicated than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that we have sunrise and sunset on Earth is because of the Earth's rotation, and the eclipse only lasts a short while because the moon is very small in the sky, and its shadow does not cover the whole Earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "But on Pandora, the gas giant it's orbiting around is much bigger, and if we use Jupiter and its moons as a reference, then the shadow of the gas giant is probably bigger than Pandora.\n",
    "In that case, the spinning of Pandora does not get it out of the \"shadow zone\".\n",
    "It can only get out of the shadow when Pandora travels across the gas giant's shadow.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now the question is, in this case, is it possible that the Eclipse only lasts a few hours?\n",
    "Here's my analysis of this system, with some of the simplest assumptions "
