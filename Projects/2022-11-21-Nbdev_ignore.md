## What this is

When using the [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) library, I often
find myself having to write

``` python
#| hide
#| eval: false
...
```

in order for that cell in Jupyter Notebook to be ignored by both the
tests and docs. It would great to have a simple directive to do this,
and this is the ignore directive:

``` python
#| ignore
...
```

It’s equivalent to the above directives.

## Installation

``` sh
pip install nbdev_ignore
```

## How to use

To enable the `#| ignore` directive, in your settings.ini make sure to:

- Add `nbdev_ignore` as a requirement
- Add `procs = nbdev_igore.core:ignore_`, where it should point to the
  exact function being called
- Add it to test flags: `tst_flags = ignore`, so that cells with this
  directive also avoids testing. If you already have other test flags,
  separate them with space. For example, if you already have `notest` as
  your test flag, then `tst_flags = notest ignore`.

## How it works

There’s only one function
[`ignore_`](https://feynlee.github.io/nbdev-ignore/core.html#ignore_) in
this module. It’s exactly the same as the [hide\_]() processor in
`nbdev`, so that “\#\| ignore” serves the same purpose as “\#\| hide”.
For details on how it works, see
[here](https://feynlee.github.io/nbdev-ignore/core.html).

In order for it to also serve as a test flag, we will need to manually
add it to `tst_flags` (see below) so tests will ignore cells with this
directive. Currently there’s no simple way to hack the `nbdev_test`
process, so this has to be done manually.

## Result
We can now write `#|ignore` for the cell to be ignored by both tests and docs, but still kept in the notebook:

```python
#|ignore

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from mock import patch

spark = (SparkSession.builder
        .config("fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider",
                "com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider")
        .appName("app_name")
        .getOrCreate()
        )

columns = ["address", "date"]
data = [("address1", "20211001")]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data).toDF(*columns)

@patch("pyspark.sql.session.DataFrameReader.load", return_value = df)
def test(spark_load_mock):
    df = fake_func(spark)
    return df

dfpd = test()
```
